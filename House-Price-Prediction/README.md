House Price Prediction With Machine Learning - Predicting the sale prices of houses is an important task for real estate businesses and investors. In this project, we will explore various Multiple Linear Regression algorithms to predict continuous variables and provide insights into which algorithm is best suited for this task. Multiple Linear Regression is an algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to predict values that are continuous in nature. It is a great algorithm to start with for beginners in ML. We will be using several linear regression algorithms, Ridge regression algorithm. These algorithms can be implemented in Python using the scikit-learn package. To determine the best model for the given task, we will evaluate each algorithm using evaluation metrics provided by the scikit-learn package. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of Multiple Linear Regression algorithms and be able to apply them to predict sale prices.
